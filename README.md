# Game-backend

This is the backend for a simple bomberman game created with Clojure. To get started, open `server.clj` and load it into your favorite REPL and then run `(start-server!)`. 

The frontend can be found hosted at [clojure-game.stjernberg.com](http://clojure-game.stjernberg.com) and it will connect to your local server and start the game with a simple press of the `enter` button.

Player controls:

| Action       | Player 1   | Player 2 |
